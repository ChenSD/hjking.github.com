# Emacs

## Starter Kit
- [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org)

Spacemacs is a user-friendly and well-documented Emacs kit that integrates the best Emacs packages out there. It uses Evil Mode to combine the ergonomic editing features of Vim with the extensibility of Emacs.

Spacemacs is designed to be approachable for users coming from Vim–you do not need prior experience with Emacs to get started.

- [Prelude](http://batsov.com/prelude/)

Prelude is an Emacs distribution that aims to enhance the default Emacs experience. Prelude alters a lot of the default settings, bundles a plethora of additional packages and adds its own core library to the mix. The final product offers an easy to use Emacs configuration for Emacs newcomers and lots of additional power for Emacs power users.
