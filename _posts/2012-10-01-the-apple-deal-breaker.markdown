#####  The Apple Deal Breaker. They're supposedly leaders in UI and UX. Not in my eyes.

My wife has a brand new iPad, running IOS6 no less. Now, having never owned an Apple product before I have no idea if this is the way it's always been or not, but I've spotted a major flaw that would bean absolute deal breaker in terms of usability for me. It's simple, so simple I can't see why they would have chosen to do it...

Upper and lower case letters on the onscreen keyboard. On my Nexus 7, when I'm in lower case mode the letters on the keyboard are lower case, when I'm in upper case mode the letters are upper case. Not so on the iPad. The onscreen keyboard letters are always upper case.

Whatever happened to the principal of "don't make me think"?

##### # UPDATE: after a comment below I went and checked my wife's iPad, sure enough, it does what I said.

Capital letters on screen but small when typing.

Now the weird blue highlight of the "shift key" means it's really capital letters.
