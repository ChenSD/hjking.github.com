#####  I last checked out the wordpress app for Android over a year ago, it was shockingly shit.

Things drastically changed after my last blog post promising more updates. I changed jobs and I'm now enjoying the sedate and relaxing lifestyle of a contractor!

That also meant that I didn't really have time to fulfill my promise of regular updates. However I'm hoping that will change now. A year or so ago I checked out the WordPress app but was disappointed to find it didn't support self hosted blogs. And seeing as mine's hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance this wasn't very useful to me. However, last night, just before we went to catch the penultimate showing of The Dark Knight Rises at the iMax a friend of mine happened to mention how great the WordPress app now was and how it supported self hosted blogs. And that brings us to now, hopefully the first of many posts from my Nexus 7.
