#####  The internet has a lot to answer for... It sure as hell does.

What kind of contraption can let me spout my bullshit to over 68 countries, from the US and UK to places as random as Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan...

Seriously though, I get between 30-50 unique visits per day. Not much, but that's 30-50 people who want to have a quick look at what I have to say. I struggle to get my wife and 2 kids to listen to me most days. Thanks to everyone who contributes to this blog by commenting, and thanks to everyone who emails me letting me know what they're using my stuff for, and yes, even thanks to the people who email me asking for help or to code their app for free just because it uses my library...
