#####  Ok, save the lynch mob until you've read the whole thing ok...

Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending Sony at all. Losing 75 million users data to a hacker is just amateurish, especially if they had to get in external 'experts' to hold their hands and figure out what happened.

Second, it couldn't have happened to a nicer company, after the debacle with George Hotz and the [PS3 hack](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2011/jan/07/playstation-3-hack-ps3) they kind of deserved to get their arses handed to them on a plate. It's just a shame it was at the cost of 75 million innocents.

But my personal rants are not what this is about.

My gripe is with all these people going 'OMFG, I can't believe Sony stored our names and addresses unencrypted'... To be honest, with a breach on this scale you can have the best encryption algorithm in the world, but if they have access to your servers (I seriously doubt this was a case of SQL injection) chances are they also have access to your encryption keys. And as everyone knows _access to your encryption keys = screwed_...

Kind of makes me glad I'm a sad, pathetic Wii owner...
