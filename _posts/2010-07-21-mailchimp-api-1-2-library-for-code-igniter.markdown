#####  MailChimp API 1.2 Library For Code Igniter

This isn't a library of my own doing as such, but is instead a wrapper for the MailChimp API 1.2 that can be found here [http://www.mailchimp.com/api/downloads/](http://www.mailchimp.com/api/downloads/) (the php version). I take no credit for the API itself just the wrapper to make it CI compatible.

Put the contents of the config folder into your config directory, put the contents of the libraries folder into your libraries directory. Follow the examples in the examples directory and for documentation on the API go to here [http://www.mailchimp.com/api/1.2/](http://www.mailchimp.com/api/1.2/). Don't worry about the initial URL stuff as that's handled by the library.

Enjoy people.
