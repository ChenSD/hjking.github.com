#####  I love my Nexus 7, it's briliant.

I've been using the Nexus 7 for some time now and I absolutely love it. The tablet's size is spot on. My wife has the new version iPad and to be honest I find the size a little restricting. It's perfect for her as she sits on the sofa catching up on email and looking through Facebook. I use mine all over the place though, in the house, out of the house, on the move, in meetings etc... and for me, after having played around with the iPad for a bit, I know I'd find the size of it restricting and frustrating.

Which brings me back to the Nexus 7. A perfect tablet for me, could do with a little more than the 16gb storage but not the end of the world. However, the majors gripe for me is the hit and miss touch screen responsiveness. 90% of the time it's superb. However, sometimes, especially when using certain apps (draw something is the worst offender) the touch screen becomes completely unresponsive. Usually turning the screen off then on again resolves the issue just fine, but I shouldn't have to do that. I've looked around the internet and I'm far from the only person having this issue. I hope Google patch this pretty quickly in Jellybean!
