#####  Making AJAX history-able!!!

Now I've been wondering about this for a while, wondering alot. And I've just recently discovered that I could have saved myself a few major headaches and near nervous breakdowns by remembering the old rule of thumb! There's always a sodding jQuery plugin for it. Apple have the tag line 'There's an app for that', Subway have the tag line 'There's a sub for that', and as usual I've forgotten the unofficial jQuery tag line, and Paddy's favorite, 'There's a jQuery plugin for that'!!!!!

Also supports Safari by the looks of it.
